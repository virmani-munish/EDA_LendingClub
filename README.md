## General Information
- Background of your project?
      Company must decide whether to approve a loan based on the applicant's profile when it receives a loan application. Two types of risks are associated with the bankâ€™s decision:If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
How can we identified defaulter based on consumer attributes and loan attributes. So that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.

- What is the dataset that is being used?

## Conclusions
- Grade: We can see that A type loan has very less defaulting rate of 5.99%. We can recommend to go with Grade A or B as they have low defaulting rate
- Purpose: Giving loans in categories like marriage, major purchase, car and credit card have very less risk. Specially car loans have less default rates.
- Loan Amount: We can recommend to provide loan below 15000, as we see less defaulting rate
- Interest Rate: its better to give loans in the normal or lower range. -recommended to keep the interest rate below 15%
- Term: It's recommended to give loan for 3 years instead of 5 years , as we see a default spike from 10% to 25% between these two.
- Income Bucket: We see less defaulting in between buckets 4-5-6, good to give loans in this range.
